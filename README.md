# Weather App using JavaScript with an API

This program is a project I made for a computer science class in university.
It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript while connecting to an API.

What is an API? click [here](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/what-is-an-api) to find out.<br>

The API used in this program is from weatherbit, see [here](https://www.weatherbit.io/).

This program displays the weather for a given location, the user can enter a location either by a GPS coordinate or the name such as Vancouver, BC, Canada.
